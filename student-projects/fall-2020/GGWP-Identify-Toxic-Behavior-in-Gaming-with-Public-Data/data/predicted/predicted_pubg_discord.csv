97,"95% of how good the Internet is depends on your ISP. The router settings will not reduce the ping and will not remove the packet loss in any way. It is better to use the settings that the provider recommends. Often, many players may experience an increase in ping and packet loss due to high network load during prime time. This is quite easy to check with a 12 hour WinMTR test using any server in another country.

and here is my steam profile: 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198385239610/.

706,"Hello. I play the game on emulator (Tencent) and I have never had problems with the controls. Until 2 days ago, when I logged in from a phone and I made another layout for controls. After I entered back on the emulator, I realized that I can't control the game as I used to do before, even though I switched back to the first layout. I reset the controls from emulator too, but they aren't responding. Not even the default ones. I tried to uninstall the game and the platform and reinstall them back, but I have the same issue.I suppose it's a bug or a glitch from the game, so please help me. thanks in advance.",0.0016870200634002686,0.00032722949981689453,0.0007628798484802246,0.0003897547721862793,0.0007140636444091797,0.0004412531852722168

1342,"<@!690674069183660183> PubG servers are cloud based. Two known providers are AWS and IBM/Softlayer. They do not use web grade hardware for game server instances. Each round played is an on-demand spin up instance. For AWS servers look at GameLift pricing. As an example a c4.xLarge can handle about 4 game instances w/ 10 players max (typical arena shooter). For something like pubg (Unreal Engine 4) you'll be running on a Windows c4.4x-8x Large. Heavy compute, high memory and bandwidth.

2072,"> <@!725068615556005958> The dev letters have suggested they are working on something in the recoil realm 
<@!700216094694178826> Currently recoil isn't sent to the server. One approach they could be looking at is actually sending it periodically from highly suspect players. Then have the server or ac analytics scrutinize it. The big hurdle here is that complex cheats read/write directly to game memory. So in order for the client to send valid recoil data it has to be sent directly to client-side AC first, then passed to memory for use. How long this would be effective is unknown. If the cheat developer figures out the process they could intercept and manipulate the data before reaching AC via ROP. http://www.security-faqs.com/what-is-rop-and-how-do-hackers-use-it.html",0.0017204880714416504,0.00032207369804382324,0.0007545650005340576,0.00038811564445495605,0.0007148087024688721,0.0004423558712005615

Do you know websites like https://minmax.gg/chickendinner or https://pubg.sh/ where you can view your past matches and see where everyone landed, and how they moved throughout the match. I was wondering is there a website where I can do the same BUT without selecting any specific player, but rather just watch matches (on specific selected map) for example just Miramar. Not sure if my question makes sense or not, I hope it does. Thanks (PS.

But I'm telling you a 2D replay is all i can provide and should be enough. A 2d replay can show they knnow where all the players are because they are tracking people from the opposite side of a mountain when the player hasnt even shot a weapon. If you want to give me a few mins of your time i can show you exactly what i mean and how a 2D replay can show this.

1. Release bot-filled lobbies on Xbox without a way to not play with them for a whole month (not launching ranked at the same time)

2. Putting out ranked mode with a leaderboard filled with a lot of cheaters when there is no fix to radar yet.

3. Pubg setup right now  is either play with bots or play against cheaters. About 35% of the ranked games I have played have contained at least one radar squad.

<@449060472218583051>  interesting but, most of this matchmaking stuff doesn’t consider that some game types might draw players who don’t want to be matched with players of their own skill level—and both new and experienced want to share a pool. I wouldn’t be here 3 years later if the game held my hand when I started. I would have quit out of bordem immediately. I know that doesn’t work for everyone and I know cross play with stadia necessitates something to balance but, a lot of papers like this seem to miss behavioral analysis in favor of pretty math that does a good job of matching similarly skilled players.

4136,"<@!327438598301548544> Can I share my own personal (and honest) list?
1) Development Muscle - We actually take on too much sometimes.  We think big, but it's hard to execute on everything in a quality way.  For instance, we have 3 current versions of the game (one more coming.. ahem) plus new games in the works.  
2) Communication, but actually this is really more of a problem in NA / EMEA.  In Korea, SEA, China - people don't complain about this.  We're headquartered in Seoul so between languages being the same, and timezones, it tends to be faster there.  In the West, its really hard to get it right.  With that said, you might have noticed an increase in the last month.  NA Community / Marketing / PR teams got a bunch of support this year, and that's why you see the regional social accounts, actually we quietly rolled out en-us as a language and we're posting blog content for US english specifically, etc.  Previously it was hard to post anything in English unless it was approved for global release.  Going forward I want to do other things like shut down the forums and move the community here, etc.
3) Cheating - We need a community driven anticheat program.  I'm working on it, I keep hoping it will launch ""this week"" but we keep needing one more to get the details tied up.
4) Partner Support - We need to do more here.  This is why we started the Creator Appreciation Program.  
5) Store Promotions - I'd like to do regional store promotions or crates.  Thinking about that one now. WackyJacky101 is also sharing some good ideas (we talk as much as we can).  He's a great guy.
6) Faster - Always faster - we need to be faster faster faster",0.0018927156925201416,0.00032067298889160156,0.000729292631149292,0.0003711283206939697,0.0007326006889343262,0.00044924020767211914

When a 1000 hour player (shown in Mastery at the end of the game) kills them, it just feels hopeless.  They can't level up.  So yeah, internally people really love it.  Even the skilled players are saying ""it's fun to kill bots"".  They kinda fade into the background.

4225,<@!316710135877599233>  i have the same feeling about the game. Playing sice early 2017. game is fundamentally unfixable. It was created on now dated engine (it was not even updated to newer version  of unreal engine) because developer never anticipated the amount of players pubg had. if they did..they would create their own engine specific for the pubg needs or modify one heavily...but its very costly procces and for sure they had no funds for this at the star. And now...they added so much to the code that every fix is just band aid over band aid. Some are peeling of and some barely holds. I doubt that after playerbase drop pubg corp will invest into something else than ugly skins.,0.0022827088832855225,0.00030869245529174805,0.0007566213607788086,0.0003604590892791748,0.0007779300212860107,0.0004253685474395752

At the same time, we know that others prefer an improvement in graphical quality. We’re looking at balancing both high framerates and graphics but of course, providing stable framerate is key no matter what. We’ll be tuning up Dynamic Resolution to provide better quality resolution as well as framerate. We also see many requests for a higher frame cap of 60 frames per second. While we’re actively looking for ways to implement this, there are challenges ahead.

4516,"ℹ️ 
@everyone Discord recently introduced logging in via QR code, which is pretty handy when the desktop version randomly decides to log you out.
NEVER and I mean NEVER scan a QR code for Discord-related gifts or prizes, including Nitro giveaways, through the Discord mobile app, EVER. You are NOT redeeming the ""prize"", you're giving someone FULL access to your account, regardless of 2FA. Until Discord adds a notice to their app, you'll have to be extremely cautious about this.

PSA to the folks who are moderators in other servers: If you see someone posting a QR code in your server and claiming it gives Nitro, DELETE IT.

Be sure to spread the word to everyone you know. This is a serious flaw with Discord's login system, and there's probably a lot of people losing accounts to this scam. 

On top of that, if anyone's trying to convince you to scan a QR code for a giveaway or whatever, please report them through here: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731",0.0034453272819519043,0.0002986490726470947,0.000927358865737915,0.00034239888191223145,0.0009063482284545898,0.0004374980926513672

6089,"Hello, I'm currently working on this FPS game  in UE4. I'm mainly a programmer so the game doesn't look amazing or anything, but atleast the code behind it works somewhat well lol. Anyhow so far I've implemented some gun machanics, inventory system and multiplayer capabilities, however I have not come up with a good setting for the game yet, or like a backstory, or anything really to explain what the game is about. If anyone has any suggestions for what it could be I'd be very happy to hear from you! I'm Kinda in to more ""tactical/realistic"" fps games, like PUBG ofc, so something in that direction would be cool. 

Here are some videos of the game sofar, some are from a while ago.

7941,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

8514,"So recently PUBG has offered gun skins for DrDisRespect and for Shroud to be purchased by the community in the game PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS .
The reasoning was for being top streamers for the game. While we don't dispute this, we believe that a 3rd skin should be offered to someone that is a true ambassador for the game.
WackyJacky101 has a love for the game that far exceeds anyone's. His positive attitude and content that he offers, keeps this community involved with the game as much as Doc and Shroud. He puts in countless hours with YT videos to help the community understand the mechanics of the game. Even the pro players praise him for his efforts to help the PUBG community get the most out of the game. This is no way to undermine the skins given to Doc and Shroud, this is merely a request to offer a third skin to someone truly deserving of the recognition.",0.0021189749240875244,0.00031253695487976074,0.0008303523063659668,0.00036093592643737793,0.0007693469524383545,0.00042173266410827637

The device known as ""Steam Link"" which lets you do things on your PC whilst someone in a room across the house plays a game launched from that same PC's Steam is usually $50 by itself but it's on SALE at an absolute steal right now!
This product is best for playing games that you want to use a controller for but don't like BigPicture Mode; or really what I like is to take a bath whilst losing in PUBG. LOL
Do consider checking these out as not only are you getting a quality product at a ridiculously cheap price but you can choose between one of three amazing games at a major sale too.

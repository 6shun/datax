# AdShift
AdShift aims to identify bias in advertising models and diversify their audience targeting strategies to combat such bias. This project was developed in collaboration between a team from the Data-X course at UC Berkeley and a team from Kinesso of Interpublic Group, with all members listed below:
  #### Data-X:
    - Shaya Barry
    - Dillon Eskandar
    - Wei Huang
    - Fernanda Ramos
    - Sneha Sudhakar
    - Zichen Zhao
  #### Kinesso:
    - Bill Lyman
    - Graham Wilkinson

Our project began by analyzing a demographic dataset which is used to represent the target audience and an dataset of impressions from Kinesso which is used to represent the actual audience reached by the current targeting model. 

The exploratory analysis for the demographic data consists of exploring the three features of age, ethnicity, and income brackets for every zipcode in the dataset. The data is broken down by zip code then categorizing by the three features and reports the count for such bracket. The analysis was also focused on zip codes and included functions where the input was a zip code and the output was a visualization of the distribution of ages or ethnicity or income for that zip code.

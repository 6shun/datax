# Visualizing Attacks in Cyberspace - DATA-X: United States Cyber Command

A simulation to model how viruses traverse through computer networks

### USCYBERCOM

- A folder containing scripts for our dynamic visualization. 
- Primary language is TypeScript.
- `install yarn` on local machine.
- Start parcel with command `yarn start` locally to view visuals in browser.


### attacksim
- An ipynb file containing the script for our static visualization. 
- Written in Python. 
- Run file on Jupyter to easily view visuals.
  
### other
- A folder containing earlier drafts of visualizations and simulations.

## Inspiration for this project
Our mentors at the United States Cyber Command approached us with inspiration from recent COVID-19 simulations which followed SIR epidemic models. In particular, it was an article written by Harry Stevens which included visualisations and graphics of what happens when people follow social-distancing rules and adhere to quarantine guidelines.

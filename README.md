# Visualizing Attacks in Cyberspace - DATA-X: United States Cyber Command

A simulation to model how viruses traverse through computer networks



### USCYBERCOM

- A folder containing scripts for our dynamic visualization. 
- Primary language is TypeScript.
- `install yarn` on local machine.
- Start parcel with command `yarn start` locally to view visuals in browser.


### attacksim
- An ipynb file containing the script for our static visualization. 
- Written in Python. 
- Run file on Jupyter to easily view visuals.
  
### other
- A folder containing earlier drafts of visualizations and simulations.


## Purpose
Since 2010, the United States Cyber Command has been making strives towards cyberspace superiority by taking proactive and risk-aware strategies against adversaries. However, apart from developing cyber-combat methods, the USCC seeks to promote STEM disciplines to facilicate and enhance the nation's cyber talent by stimulating the interest of curious and technical individuals. The simulations that our team has developed will help bridge the knowledge gap between the general public and the complex universe of cyberspace by providing a simplified and accessible model to all. 

Perhaps inquisitive individuals will come across this simulation and wonder how exactly does active threat hunting or other cyber defense methods work in real cyberspace.

## Inspiration for this project
Our mentors at the United States Cyber Command approached us with inspiration from recent COVID-19 simulations which followed SIR epidemic models. In particular, it was an [article written by Harry Stevens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) which included visualisations and graphics of what happens when people follow social-distancing rules and adhere to quarantine guidelines.

Our USCC mentors explained that they wanted us to product an interactive, web-based visualization along the lines of Stevens' simulation. They suggested that the interface shuold allow users to adjust parameters (e.g. assumptions about the threat and network derfenses), as well as for the selection of several pre-defined, stylized scenarios to demonstrate the impacts of specific strategies (e.g. perimeter defense, zero-trust networking, and active threat hunting).

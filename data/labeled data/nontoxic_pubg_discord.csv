Also, by making one map in a separate queue to every other map, you’ve INCREASED queues 🤦🏼‍♂️ And why no solo or duos on the map?!? Genuinely, I question the intelligence of the people making these decisions. It’s absolutely preposterous that you think you’re improving things.
<@490548703208144906> 
Release of Paramo is an experimental way of doing seasonal content which is why it's in the separate queue we call labs. It was decided to be only released in squads because squads is the most played gamemode by far compared to others so it would have the least impact on splitting the playerbase/increasing queue times. Insulting others intelligence because you disagree on their decisions is not constructive.
